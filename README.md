# Magma - Scroll-based Website Animation

![Project Preview](project_preview.gif)

## Description

I created this project as a scroll-based website animation to showcase my skills and creativity as a front-end developer. The website leverages user scrolling to trigger various animations and effects, providing an engaging and interactive user experience. I designed the animations to be smooth and seamless, creating a visually pleasing presentation.

The website uses GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) and Locomotive Scroll to achieve the dynamic animations. It also includes canvas-based animations that simulate video sequences, adding further depth and visual appeal to certain sections of the website.

## Key Features

- Scroll-based Interactivity: The website's animations and effects respond to the user's scrolling actions, creating an immersive and interactive experience.

- Smooth Animations: GSAP and Locomotive Scroll are used to ensure that all animations are seamless and visually appealing.

- Canvas Effects: Some sections of the website include canvas-based animations that simulate video sequences, adding dynamic visuals.

- ScrollTrigger Plugin: The ScrollTrigger plugin from GSAP is employed to synchronize scroll behavior with animations, ensuring elements respond appropriately to the user's scrolling.

- Staggered Animations: Text elements in specific sections are animated with a stagger effect, enhancing visual appeal.

- Responsive Design: The website is designed to be responsive, adapting to various screen sizes and devices for a consistent experience.
